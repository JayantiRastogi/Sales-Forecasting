# Sales-Forecasting
In the competitive world of retail, accurate demand forecasting plays a vital role in inventory optimization, minimizing waste, planning logistics, and shaping promotional campaigns. Predicting sales accurately - across store formats and locations - can drastically improve operational efficiency.

In this project, we aim to build a robust, data-driven forecasting model that predicts **daily product sales at the store level**. The model is built on historical data enriched with engineered temporal features, encoded attributes, and time series patterns.
